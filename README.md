# Image Classification Project

This project uses a subset of the Animals with Attributes 2 dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. Key steps include:

1. Preparing the dataset by selecting specific classes and balancing the number of images per class.
2. Resizing and normalizing images to ensure consistency.
3. Applying data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.
4. Training a simple CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
5. Evaluating the model on original, manipulated, and color-corrected test sets.

## Dataset
- Source: [Animals with Attributes 2](https://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/awa2/)
## Kaggle Link

## Steps
1. Data Preparation
2. Image Preprocessing
3. Data Augmentation
4. Model Training
5. Evaluation and Analysis

## Results
The model's accuracy is compared across original, manipulated, and color-corrected datasets to assess its performance under different conditions.
